How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs is as easy as asking the user what they would like to see in the deliverable! By creating user stories, we can see exactly
who the user is and the reasoning behind why they would like to see a feature added to the product. Implementing the user stories should be established on an
importance scale, with the most important being implemented first.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Approaching developing programs should always start with a plan. Establishing a timeline and a plan for development will keep you accountable to 
finishing certain features on important deadlines. This ensures that the entire program is finished within the time allotted. Some agile process 
that we should incorporate into our development work are testing alongside development. This allows the developers to establish issues with the 
code in a short amount of time.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development I believe starts with communication. Communicating with your team is essential to everything
related to the project, from issues to successes, communcation will bring a good team up to a high performing team.
